# SpacePals

Welcome to spacepals! A fun project that we made for Hack@Brown 2024! Users can go around and take photos of different "space aliens" and our project will tell you what animal it is and add it to your Traveler's Guide to the Galaxy. From there, you can look at a picture of the animal and learn some information about it.

## Running

To run, move into the backend directory and run:

    . python main.py

Then, move into the frontend directory and run:

    . npm start

You may need to install a couple of things for the frontend and backend so install whatever the console is telling you that can't be found.
